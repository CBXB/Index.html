        <p id="important">I have worked in Operations Management for over 8 years, ultimately gaining experience in data analysis,
            project management, facilities management, data mining, and procurement at a variety of levels. As a
            Director, I take pride in ensuring optimal utilization of personal and other resources. There is nothing
            better than ending a project where everybody is happy with the end result.
        </p>
        <p class="not-as-special">I am also focused on putting my passions and skills to good use by supporting organizations and projects that
            I really care about whether itâ€™s cooking a meal for the kids at C24/7 Father's Arms Ministries or making
            sure Lydia Home nutrition and wellness program is in compliance with Illinois State Board of Education and
            DCFS.
        </p>
        <p>Currently I am responsible for interpreting and integrating data from multiple sources and develop it into
            analysis to improve quality controls for Safe families USA as well as planning, organizing and directing
            maintenance and food services departments at Lydia Home. I manage, supervise and oversee training of
            personnel. I coordinate all culinary activities as well as repairs and alteration of buildings and grounds.
            I plan and develop all facilities and new construction projects; ensuring that jobs are completed
            efficiently and within regulatory guidelines and projected deadlines.
